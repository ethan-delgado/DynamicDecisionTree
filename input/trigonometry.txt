----If Side length, Are you given the other 2 side lengths?
------If Yes, Solve for a^2 + b^2 = c^2 where a and b are the respective leg lengths and c is the hypotenuse length (Ex: If a = 3, b = 4, find c: c = sqrt(3² + 4²) = 5).
------If No, Are you given a side length and an angle?
--------If Yes, Are you given the hypotenuse or a leg??
----------If Hypotenuse, Are you asked to find the side length adjacent or opposite to the given angle?
------------If Adjacent, Calculate the length of the leg by multiplying the hypotenuse length by the cosine of the given angle (Ex: If Hypotenuse = 5, angle = 60°, find Adjacent side: Adjacent = 5 * cos(60°) = 2.5).
------------If Opposite, Calculate the length of the leg by multiplying the hypotenuse length by the sine of the given angle (Ex: If Hypotenuse = 5, angle = 60°, find Opposite side: Opposite = 5 * sin(60°) ≈ 4.33).
----------If Leg, Is the given angle adjacent or opposite to the leg whose length you are asked to find?
------------If Adjacent, Calculate the length of the missing side by dividing the length of the given leg by the cosine of the given angle (Ex: If Adjacent side = 3, angle = 60°, find Hypotenuse: Hypotenuse = 3 / cos(60°) = 6).
------------If Opposite, Calculate the length of the missing side by dividing the length of the given leg by the sine of the given angle (Ex: If Opposite side = 3, angle = 60°, find Hypotenuse: Hypotenuse = 3 / sin(60°) ≈ 3.46).
--------If No, Try to use other methods to gain more information and help you find the side length.
----If Angle, Are you given the length of the 2 sides of the triangle?
------If Yes, Which 2 side lengths were you given?
--------If 2 legs, Calculate the angle by taking the arctangent of the leg length opposite the angle divided by the leg length adjacent to the angle (Ex: If Opposite side = 4, Adjacent side = 3, find angle: Angle = arctan(4/3) ≈ 53.13°).
--------If 1 leg and 1 hypotenuse, Is the given leg length adjacent or opposite to the angle you are trying to find?
----------If Adjacent, Calculate the angle by taking the arccosine of the leg length adjacent to the angle divided by the length of the hypotenuse (Ex: If Adjacent side = 3, Hypotenuse = 5, find angle: Angle = arccos(3/5) ≈ 53.13°).
----------If Opposite, Calculate the angle by taking the arcsine of the leg length opposite the angle divided by the length of the hypotenuse (Ex: If Opposite side = 4, Hypotenuse = 5, find angle: Angle = arcsin(4/5) ≈ 53.13°).
------If No, Are you given the other acute angle?
--------If Yes, Calculate the the angle by subtracting the given acute angle from 90 (Ex: If one acute angle is 30°, find other acute angle: Other Angle = 90 - 30 = 60°)
--------If No, Try to use other methods to gain more information and help you find the angle.
----If Area, Are you given the lengths of two sides that form the right angle?

--If No, What are you asked to find?
----If Side length, Are you given all three angles and one side or two sides and one included angle?
------If All three angles and one side, Use the Law of Sines to find the unknown side: a/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C) (Ex: If angle A = 30°, side a = 2, angle B = 60°, find side b: b = sin(60°) * (2 / sin(30°)) = 4)
------If Two sides and one included angle, Use the Law of Cosines to find the unknown side: c² = a² + b² - 2abcos(C) (Ex: If a = 3, b = 4, angle C = 60°, find c: c = sqrt(3² + 4² - 2 * 3 * 4cos(60°)) = 1).
----If Angle, Are you given all three sides or two angles?
------If All three sides, Use the Law of Cosines to find the unknown angle: Take the arccosine of [a² + b² - c²] / 2ab to find the unknown angle (Ex: If a = 3, b = 4, c = 5, find angle A: A = arccos((3² + 4² - 5²) / (2*3*4)) ≈ 36.87°)
------If Two angles, Subtract the sum of the two known angles from 180° to find the unknown angle (Ex: If angle A = 60° and angle B = 50°, find angle C: C = 180 - 60 - 50 = 70°).
----If Area, Are you given two sides and the included angle?
------If Yes, Use the formula 1/2 * a * b * sin(C) to find the area (Ex: If a = 3, b = 4, and C = 60°, Area = 1/2 * 3 * 4 * sin(60°) = 3.46).
------If No, Are you given all three sides?
--------If Yes, Use Heron's formula to find the area: sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] where s is half the perimeter of the triangle given by (a + b + c) / 2 (Ex: If a = 2, b = 3, and c = 4, s = (2 + 3 + 4) / 2 = 4.5, then Area = sqrt[4.5(4.5 - 2)(4.5 - 3)(4.5 - 4)] = 2.9).
--------If No, Try to use other methods to gain more information and help you find the area.
----If Height, Are you given the longest side and its opposite angle?
------If Yes, Use the relationship h = a * sin(B) where h is the height, a is the side length, and B is the opposite angle (Ex: If a = 3 and B = 60°, height = 3 * sin(60°) ≈ 2.6).
------If No, Try to use other methods to gain more information and help you find the height.
----If Solution To Trigonometric Equation/Expression, Which identity or formula category does it belong to?

--------If sin(θ) (Ex: sin(θ) = 0.6), Use the identity: cos(θ) = sqrt(1 - sin^2(θ)) (Ex: If sin(θ) = 0.6, cos(θ) = sqrt(1 - 0.6^2) = 0.8).
--------If cos(θ) (Ex: cos(θ) = 0.5), Use the identity: sin(θ) = sqrt(1 - cos^2(θ)) (Ex: If cos(θ) = 0.5, sin(θ) = sqrt(1 - 0.5^2) = 0.87).
------If Angle Sum or Difference (Ex: sin(45° + 30°) = ?), Are you working with sine, cosine, or tangent?
--------If Sine (Ex: sin(45° + 30°) = ?), Use the identity: sin(A ± B) = sin(A)cos(B) ± cos(A)sin(B) (Ex: If A = 30° and B = 60°, sin(A + B) = sin(30°)cos(60°) + cos(30°)sin(60°)).
--------If Cosine (Ex: cos(45° - 30°) = ?), Use the identity: cos(A ± B) = cos(A)cos(B) ± sin(A)sin(B) (Ex: If A = 30° and B = 60°, cos(A - B) = cos(30°)cos(60°) + sin(30°)sin(60°)).
--------If Tangent (Ex: tan(45° + 30°) = ?), Use the identity: tan(A ± B) = (tan(A) ± tan(B)) / (1 ± tan(A)tan(B)) (Ex: If A = 45° and B = 30°, tan(A + B) = (tan(45°) + tan(30°)) / (1 - tan(45°)tan(30°))).
------If Double Angle (Ex: sin(230°) = ?), Are you working with sine, cosine, or tangent?
--------If Sine (Ex: sin(230°) = ?), Use the identity: sin(2θ) = 2sin(θ)cos(θ) (Ex: If θ = 30°, sin(2θ) = 2sin(30°)cos(30°)).
--------If Cosine (Ex: cos(230°) = ?), Use the identity: cos(2θ) = cos^2(θ) - sin^2(θ) or 2cos^2(θ) - 1 or 1 - 2sin^2(θ) (Ex: If θ = 30°, cos(2θ) = 2cos^2(30°) - 1).
--------If Tangent (Ex: tan(230°) = ?), Use the identity: tan(2θ) = (2tan(θ)) / (1 - tan^2(θ)) (Ex: If θ = 30°, tan(2θ) = 2tan(30°) / (1 - tan^2(30°))).
------If Product-to-Sum (Ex: 2sin(30°)sin(45°) = ?), Are you working with sine, cosine, or a mix of both?
--------If Sine (Ex: 2sin(30°)sin(45°) = ?), Use the identity: 2sin(A)sin(B) = cos(A - B) - cos(A + B) (Ex: If A = 45° and B = 30°, 2sin(45°)sin(30°) = cos(15°) - cos(75°)).
--------If Cosine (Ex: 2cos(30°)cos(45°) = ?), Use the identity: 2cos(A)cos(B) = cos(A + B) + cos(A - B) (Ex: If A = 45° and B = 30°, 2cos(45°)cos(30°) = cos(75°) + cos(15°)).
--------If Mix of both (Ex: 2sin(30°)cos(45°) = ?), Use the identity: 2sin(A)cos(B) = sin(A + B) + sin(A - B) or 2cos(A)sin(B) = sin(A + B) - sin(A - B) (Ex: If A = 45° and B = 30°, 2sin(45°)cos(30°) = sin(75°) + sin(15°)).
