Does the lim n→∞ of An equal to 0 (do the values in the series approach 0 as the number of terms increases)?
--If Yes, is the series a known series?
----If Arithmetic Series (where each number is some constant added to the previous number), the series diverges.
----If Geometric Series (where each number is some factor multiplied by the previous number), is the absolute value of the multiplication factor less than 1?
------If Yes, the series converges to a1/1-r (the first term divided by 1 minus the multiplication factor).
------If No, the series diverges.
----If Harmonic Series, this series diverges.
----If Alternating series (where each term has the opposite sign of the previous term), is |an| decreasing as n→∞ (does the absolute value of each term decrease)?
------If Yes, this series converges.
------If No, this series diverges.
----If P Series (where each term is 1 over n to some exponent, p), is p > 1?
------If Yes, the series converges.
------If No, the series diverges.
----If None of the above, is the series greater than a series known to diverge (such as harmonic series, increasing Alternating Series, Arithmetic Series, increasing Geometric Series)?
------If Yes, the series diverges.
------If No, is the series less than a series known to converge (such as decreasing Alternating Series, Decreasing Geometric Series, P Series where P > 1)?
--------If Yes, the series converges.
--------If No, can an integral of the sequence be taken?
----------If Yes, does the improper integral from 1 to ∞ of An exist?
------------If Yes, the series converges.
------------If No, does the limit as b→∞ of the integral from 1 to b of the sequence = +∞?
--------------If Yes, the series diverges.
--------------If No, is lim n→∞|(an+1)/(an)| = 1 (is the limit as you approach the (n + 1)th term / nth term = 1)?
----------------If Yes, we cannot determine if the series converges or diverges.
----------------If No, is lim n→∞|(an+1)/(an)| < 1?
