Is the residential property's legal description available and valid?
--If Yes, Are you able to inspect the interior and exterior of the residential property in person?
----If Yes, Have you examined the home's structural elements (e.g., foundation, roof, walls) and its key systems (like plumbing, electrical, heating)?
------If Yes, Have you assessed the value of the actual land (based on prices of similar empty lots nearby)?
--------If Yes, Have you factored in local amenities (like distance to schools, parks, malls) and distinctive elements (like a garden, unique design)?
----------If Yes, Have you checked for any zoning or usage restrictions (e.g., limits on extensions or business activities)?
------------If Yes, Are you aware of upcoming projects (like new highways or shopping districts) that might affect the residential property's value?
--------------If Yes, Can you identify recently sold homes that resemble the one you're appraising in aspects such as location, size, age, and condition?
----------------If Yes, Are you equipped to adjust the comparables' values based on differences with the subject property (like accounting for an additional garage)?
------------------If Yes, Did you examine market trends (like seeing if home values in that vicinity are rising or declining)?
--------------------If Yes, In light of your trend analysis, do the changes to the comparables make sense (like tweaking the price based on recent sales patterns)?
----------------------If Yes, Did you double-check all gathered data (like verifying room count, property size) and reflect on the property's past value (like old sales rates)?
------------------------If Yes, Draft your appraisal report considering all previous steps. Calculate the final estimated value drawing from recent sales of comparable homes nearby, adjusting for differences. (e.g., Add $7,000 for an additional bathroom in the subject property compared to a comparable)
------------------------If No, Re-check all details, ponder on the home's historical worth, and then draft your appraisal report. Adjust the valuation using the comparable sales method. (e.g., If the subject house has a basement, deduct $8,000 from a comparable without one)
----------------------If No, Re-examine your market trends and adjust the comparables accordingly. Then, follow the decision tree again. (e.g., If the local market's falling, slash the comparables' value by 4%)
--------------------If No, Undertake a fresh market trend assessment and fine-tune the comparables accordingly. Then, proceed with the decision tree. (e.g., Analyze sales trends in the locality over the past year and adjust comparables as needed)
------------------If No, Which methodology will you adopt for final property valuation?
--------------------If Cost Approach (estimating construction cost for a similar home), Did you confirm all information (like exact property dimensions)?
----------------------If Yes, Create your appraisal report. To calculate the final valuation, estimate the present construction cost for a similar property and subtract depreciation. (e.g., If it costs $210,000 to build a similar home now and depreciation stands at $15,000, the value is $195,000)
----------------------If No, Re-confirm every detail. Draft your appraisal report. Deduct depreciation from the present construction cost of a similar property to get the valuation. (e.g., If building costs are $240,000 and depreciation is $25,000, value stands at $215,000)
--------------------If Income Approach (based on potential rental income), Have you re-confirmed all data (like room count)?
----------------------If Yes, Pen down your appraisal report. Estimate the property's value by assessing the net operating income (from renting similar homes after deducting operating costs but pre-loan and taxes) and dividing it by the capitalization rate. (e.g., If net income is $11,000 and the cap rate is 5.5%, valuation is $200,000)
----------------------If No, Double-check all details. Draft the report. Calculate value using net income from potential rents and the capitalization rate. (e.g., For a net income of $13,000 and a cap rate of 6.5%, valuation is $200,000)
----------------If No, Which methodology will you pick for final property valuation?
------------------If Cost Approach, Calculate the valuation by estimating the current building cost of a similar property minus depreciation. (e.g., Building a like property now costs $290,000 and after $35,000 depreciation, the value is $255,000)
------------------If Income Approach, Determine the valuation by estimating net income from potential rents of similar homes and dividing by the cap rate. (e.g., If net income is $16,000 and cap rate is 8%, valuation equals $200,000)
--------------If No, Research upcoming developments, gauge their value implications, and restart the decision tree. (e.g., A soon-to-be-built sports facility nearby might boost the property's worth)
------------If No, Unearth any zoning or usage rules for the property and measure their effect on its worth. Revisit the decision tree afterward. (e.g., If the house is in a heritage zone, it might affect extension possibilities and value)
----------If No, Look into local amenities, unique elements, and any environmental factors that could affect value. Then, refer back to the decision tree. (e.g., Proximity to a lake or special architectural facets can be a plus)
--------If No, Evaluate the land's worth based on similar empty lots nearby. Resume the decision tree afterward. (e.g., If comparable vacant lots are priced at $55,000 locally, include this in your value estimation)
------If No, Inspect the home's structure and essential systems post-inspection. Then, follow the decision tree. (e.g., Scrutinize the basement for moisture issues, check the HVAC system, and review wiring)
----If No, Attempt to secure the homeowner's consent for an in-person inspection. Post-inspection, use the decision tree. (e.g., Coordinate with the homeowner for a suitable time for the appraisal)
--If No, First, secure a legitimate legal description for the property. Once achieved, refer back to the decision tree. (e.g., Engage with legal experts or local administrative bodies for the right legal description)
