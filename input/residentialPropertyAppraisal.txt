------------If No, Research any zoning or usage rules for the property and measure their effect on its worth. Revisit the decision tree once done. (e.g., If the house is in a heritage zone, the value of the property might be $30,000 less due to limited extension options)

(e.g., If comparable vacant lots are priced at $80 per square foot, and your property is 1000 square feet, your land is worth $80,0000. Consider using multiple other vacant lots, averaging the price per square foot, to get a more accurate value)
------If No, Inspect the home's structure and essential systems post-inspection. Then, come back to this decision tree. (e.g., Scrutinize the basement for moisture issues, check the HVAC system, and review wiring. Any major issues can reduce the property's value significantly)

--If No, First, get a legal description for the commercial property. A legal description can usually be found in the most recent deed to the property. Consult local authorities or check legal documentation for the correct legal description. Once obtained, redo the decision tree.
