What does your function consist of?
--If One simple term (ex: log(x) or 2x^3), What type of function are you dealing with?
----If Constant, The derivative of any constant is 0.
----If Polynomial (ex: 3x^2), Find the derivative by multiplying your coefficient by the exponent, then reducing your exponent by 1 (ex: the derivative of 3x^2 is (3 * 2)x^(2-1)= 6x).
----If Trigonometric (ex: cos(x)), Which trigonometric function are you dealing with?
------If Sin, The derivative of sin(x) is cos(x).
------If Cos, The derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x).
------If Tan, The derivative of tan(x) is sec^2(x) or 1/cos^2(x).
------If Sec, The derivative of sec(x) is sec(x)tan(x).
------If Csc, The derivative of csc(x) is -csc(x)cot(x).
------If Cot, The derivative of cot(x) is -csc^2(x) or -1/sin^2(x).
------If Arcsin, The derivative of arcsin(x) is 1/√(1 - x^2).
------If Arccos, The derivative of arccos(x) is -1/√(1 - x^2).
------If Arctan, The derivative of arctan(x) is 1/(1 + x^2).
------If Arcsec, The derivative of arcsec(x) is 1/(|x|√(x^2 - 1)).
------If Arccsc, The derivative of arccsc(x) is -1/(|x|√(x^2 - 1)).
------If Arccot, The derivative of arccot(x) is -1/(1 + x^2).
----If Exponential (ex: 2^x), What is your base?
------If e, Find the derivative by multiplying your original function by the derivative of the exponent (ex: the derivative of e^2x = 2e^2x).
------If A constant other than e (ex: 3), Find the derivative by multiplying your original function by the derivative of the exponent and the natural log of the base (ex: the derivative of 3^4x is ln(3)*4*3^4x).
----If Logarithmic (ex: ln(x)), Are you dealing with a natural log?
------If Yes, Find the derivative by getting the reciprocal of your x (ex: the derivative of ln(x) is  1/x).
------If No, Find the derivative by getting the reciprocal of your x and dividing it by the natural log of your log base (ex: the derivative of log base 10 of x is 1/(x * ln(10))).
--If One composite term (ex: ln(5x)), Find the derivative by differentiating the outer function and multiplying it by the derivative of the inner function (ex: the derivative of ln(5x) is 1/5x * 5 = 1/x). If you are unable to differentiate one of the terms, redo the decision tree to find the derivative of that term.

--If Multiple terms (ex: 2x + sin(x)), What operation are you dealing with?
----If Product of 2 terms (ex: 2x * sin(x)), Find the derivative by adding the first term multiplied by the derivative of the second term and the second term multiplied by the derivative of the first term (ex: the derivative of 2x * sin(x) is 2x*cos(x) + sin(x)*2 = 2xcos(x) + 2sin(x). If you are unable to differentiate one of the terms, redo the decision tree to find the derivative of that term. When finished, you may verify your answer by entering your function on www.wolframalpha.com/calculators/derivative-calculator.
----If Quotient of 2 terms (ex: cos(x) / e^x), Find the derivative of the numerator, find the derivative of the denominator, multiply the derivative of the denominator by the original numerator, then subtract the product of the original denominator and the derivative of the numerator, all over the original denominator squared (ex: the derivative of cos(x) / e^x is (-sin(x) * e^x - cos(x) * e^x) / (e^x)^2 = (-sin(x) - cos(x))/e^x). If you are unable to differentiate one of the terms, redo the decision tree to find the derivative of that term. When finished, you may verify your answer by entering your function on www.wolframalpha.com/calculators/derivative-calculator.
----If Sum of 2 terms (ex: x + ln(x)), Find the derivative by differentiating each term separately, then adding the derivatives (ex: the derivative of  x + ln(x) is 1 + 1/x). If you are unable to differentiate one of the terms, redo the decision tree to find the derivative of that term. When finished, you may verify your answer by entering your function on www.wolframalpha.com/calculators/derivative-calculator.
----If Difference of 2 terms (ex: e^x - x^2), Find the derivative by differentiating each term separately, then subtracting the derivatives (ex: the derivative of e^x - x^2 is e^x - 2x). If you are unable to differentiate one of the terms, redo the decision tree to find the derivative of that term.
