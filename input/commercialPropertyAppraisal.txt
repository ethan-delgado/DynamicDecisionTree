Do you have a valid legal description that is sufficient to identify the exact commercial property?
--If Yes, Can you physically inspect the property, both the interior and exterior?
----If Yes, Have you evaluated the structural integrity of the property (foundation, roof, fa√ßade, etc.) and its building systems such as HVAC, electrical, and plumbing?
------If Yes, Have you determined the value of the land itself, based on prices of similar commercial vacant lots in the area?
--------If Yes, Have you accounted for local commercial amenities (proximity to transportation hubs, business districts, commercial services) and unique commercial features (loading docks, commercial kitchens, conference rooms)?
----------If Yes, Have you assessed the impact of zoning laws or use restrictions on the property's value (e.g. limits on height or business type)?
------------If Yes, Have you factored in any future developments (e.g. new transport links or business parks) that could affect the property's value?
--------------If Yes, Can you find recently sold commercial properties (known as comparables) similar in function, location, size, and condition?
----------------If Yes, Can you adjust the value of the comparables for differences like square footage, commercial facilities, or parking spaces?
------------------If Yes, Have you conducted a market trend analysis for commercial properties in the area (checking if commercial property values are rising or declining)?
--------------------If Yes, Based on this trend analysis, are your adjustments to the comparables justifiable (e.g., adjusting price due to an uptick in local business growth)?
----------------------If Yes, Have you verified all gathered data (checking specifics like total floor space, tenant capacity, etc.) and reflected on the property's historical commercial value (past lease rates, sales prices)?
------------------------If Yes, Complete your appraisal report, factoring in everything previously mentioned. Adjust the valuation using comparables' prices and differing features (e.g.: If the subject property has a larger parking lot, add $20,000 to the comparable's price)
------------------------If No, Confirm your data, reconsider its historical commercial value, then compile your report. Adjust the valuation using the prices of comparables and distinct features (e.g.: If the subject property is closer to a major highway, add $15,000 to the comparable's price)
----------------------If No, Reassess your market trend analysis and adjust the comparables. After that, redo the decision tree (e.g.: If businesses are relocating out of the area, reduce the comparable's value by 10%)
--------------------If No, Undertake a fresh market trend analysis and adjust the comparables. Redo the decision tree afterward. (e.g.: Examine the past year's leasing trends in the commercial district and adjust comparables)
------------------If No, Which valuation method will you employ for the commercial property?
--------------------If Cost approach, Have you confirmed all details like property size, tenant capacity, etc.?
----------------------If Yes, Submit your appraisal report with the collected details. Calculate the final valuation by estimating today's cost of constructing a similar commercial building and accounting for depreciation (e.g.: If constructing a similar building costs $1M today and depreciation is $100K, valuation is $900K)
----------------------If No, Reconfirm all details. Afterwards, compile your report with the present cost of constructing a similar commercial building, taking into account depreciation (e.g.: If construction costs are $1.2M and depreciation is $200K, valuation is $1M)
--------------------If Income Approach, Have you confirmed all details like property size, potential lease rates, etc.?
----------------------If Yes, Compile your appraisal report. Calculate the valuation by estimating net operating income from similar commercial rentals and dividing it by the capitalization rate (e.g.: If net income is $50K and the capitalization rate is 5%, valuation is $1M)
----------------------If No, Recheck all details. Then, compile your report, estimating net operating income from similar commercial rentals and dividing it by the capitalization rate (e.g.: If net income is $60K and the capitalization rate is 6%, valuation is $1M)
----------------If No, Which valuation approach will you use for the commercial property?
------------------If Cost approach, Calculate the final valuation by estimating the present cost of constructing a similar commercial property, factoring in depreciation (e.g.: If today's construction cost is $1.5M and depreciation is $250K, valuation is $1.25M)
------------------If Income Approach, Calculate the valuation by estimating net income based on similar commercial rentals, then dividing by the capitalization rate (e.g.: If net income is $70K and the capitalization rate is 7%, valuation is $1M)
--------------If No, Confirm any upcoming developments and their potential impact on commercial property value. Redo the decision tree (e.g.: A business park being developed nearby may increase the value of the property by $40,000)
------------If No, Examine any zoning laws or use restrictions for the commercial property and their potential impact. (e.g.: If the property is zoned only for retail, adjust the valuation). Redo the decision tree once finished.
----------If No, Assess local commercial amenities, special features, and environmental factors impacting value. For example, nearby train station may increase the value of the land by $50,000, while a nearby polluting factory would decrease it by $75,000. Redo the decision tree once done.
--------If No, Estimate the value of the land based on similar commercial vacant lots. Redo the decision tree (e.g.: If a similarly sized commercial lot is worth $5 per square foot and your lot is $30,000 square feet, your land itself is worth $150,000. Consider using multiple other vacant lots, averaging the price per square foot, to get a more accurate value)
------If No, Inspect the property's structural integrity and systems, then return to the decision tree (e.g.: Ensure the HVAC system is adequate for the building size)
----If No, Attempt to obtain access from the property owner for inspection. Afterwards, redo the decision tree (e.g.: Coordinate a site visit at a time convenient for existing tenants)
--If No, First, get a legal description for the commercial property. A legal description can usually be found in the most recent deed to the property. Consult local authorities or check legal documentation for the correct legal description. Once obtained, redo the decision tree.
